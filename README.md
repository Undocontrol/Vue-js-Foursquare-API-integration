### Summary and intro

I chose Vue.js as my front end framework because it's intuitive and quick to get up and running. I've split the application into basic components, created an API utility file (which in future, would be useful for an application that makes a lot of API calls). The "Home" page makes a hard coded call to Foursquare for now, with just the users search being added dynamically.
